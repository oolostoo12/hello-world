First time using Github

Hello, I am Luis Chavez, a computer engineering student at California State University, Northridge. After about 3 semesters of peer pressure from me fellow classmates, I finally made a Github. I guess it's time to awake my dormant creative giant in my head. I will post projects whenever I can. They will mostly be random project I just get the feeling to make, though it would be cool if some collaborators here would make my projects looks pretty wit some GUI. Unfortunetaly, I was never taught GUI in my JAVA and C classes, it is something I would like to learn to show off to my non-computer field friends.
